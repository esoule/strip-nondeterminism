=head1 DEPRECATION PLAN

This was added in mid-2017. As-of 2020-04-30, Debian ships a total of 8 .cpio
files in binary packages and none of these appear to be integral to the working
of those package.

After consulting with the original (Bernhard, ie. OpenSuse) this handler is a
good candidate to commence deprecation via initially making it optional.

	my ($file) = @_;

	# to not have Archive::Cpio as a hard requirement
	# for strip-nondeterminism

		if ($File::StripNondeterminism::verbose) {
			print STDERR "Archive::Cpio not found\n";

	eval {$cpio->read($file)};
	return 0 if $@; # not a cpio archive if it throws an error
	foreach my $e ($cpio->get_files()) {
		$e->{mtime} = $File::StripNondeterminism::canonical_time;

	$cpio->write($file);
